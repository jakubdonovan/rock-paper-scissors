A simple online Rock Paper Scissors application


## Live Demo
You can view the demo [here](https://jakubdonovan.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/).

## TODO IN THE FUTURE:
* Redesign the skin of the game and implement nicer text and animations to create a more refined look and to improve the user experience. Some potential ideas to make use of:
  - https://codepen.io/jakubdonovan/pen/XWKMwOQ
  - https://codepen.io/jakubdonovan/pen/WNxpBmz

* Allow the player to invite a friend to the game
    - Allow both players to change their usernames
    - Allow the host to adjust the winner announcement message (include the option to set a stake/bet)
